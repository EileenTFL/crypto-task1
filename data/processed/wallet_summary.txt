### Task 1 — Simple Insights (Bonus)

- Looking at the **latest 5 transactions** on the Ethereum Foundation wallet.
- Money **coming in** was about **0.60 ETH** and **going out** was **0.13 ETH**, so the wallet **ended up +0.47 ETH** overall.
- It interacted with a **small number of other wallets** (3 sent to it, 2 it sent to) — that’s normal and not noisy.
-  **Didn’t notice any “quick in, quick out” moves**, no back-and-forth ping-pong between the same two wallets, and no sudden burst of payments to lots of new wallets.
- The **amounts are small**, and nothing here obviously looks shady.

> Note: This is based on just 5 recent transactions. Signs that would look suspicious include:
> lots of very fast hops (peel chains), many tiny split transfers, repeated round-trips between two wallets, sending to known mixer services/exchanges in odd patterns, or unusually high fees.
